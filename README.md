Hello, dears!

I'm Ivan Trunaev, GPU Officer from Russia, Uray.

I'm still joy of Hardcode Open-Source, and keep: If you code based of my released, better, public your distribution in Open-Source kind of releasingship.

What in my repository "mucie_perl"?

Modificated code for Chips Firmwares for Solar Elecro System Engines. 
Old code, used all around by World using sin() function, and I feeled before I start to code, than it bad: because sin() is unlimited to conlulation, if you don't agree, I recommend you to teach of Mathematical Science!
 
Code navigation:

* Electro.pas - first release
* Electro_patch2025.pas - patch for old Moon Calendar (I increment Input Signal for 24*60*60*2 - daytimes in secronds multipiend on two).
* Electro_patch_v2.pas - last release. Optimized by using buffer for preparing multipier of wave signal modulation)
* Electro_patch_2025_v2.pas - last release of version of Firmware for old Moon Calendar (looking patched Electro_patch_v2.pas).
